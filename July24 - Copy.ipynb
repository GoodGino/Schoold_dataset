Not all speakers are worth your time and money. This little Cube speaker by iGadgitz is a very interesting speaker; it may be little but it has big sound and it works very well. I did find one potential issue when it comes to the range of operation that I will describe below.<br /><br />This is one of the smallest speakers I have seen and used. In spite of its size, it is a solid and hefty little speaker, weighing more than you\\'d expect. In my mind this is a good sign: it means that there is more to this little speaker than a cheap little speaker and a sub-par receiver. To be honest I was a little skeptical that it would put out good sound when I first saw this speaker. It has pleasantly surprised me (more on that shortly).<br /><br />This speaker pairs and connects very easily. When it is in discoverable mode it identifies itself as \\\\\\\\\"Xquare 2\\\\\\\\\". I had no issue with it pairing to my phone and once connected it remained connected without issue.<br /><br />The range on this speaker is good and I have been able to carry it from the source to a distance between 20\\' - 30\\' before it began to stutter or cut out. I have seen speakers that have more range but the majority of them fall into this threshold. Now, that said I need to mention an issue that came up in testing that should be kept in mind. If the speaker is sitting such that the switch and controls are facing down (that is, the control side is on the flat surface where it is sitting) the range is cut very dramatically. With the speaker sitting that way the range dropped to about 6\\' before it started cutting out. It did not seem to matter if it was the speaker that was moving away from the source or the other way around.<br /><br />I loaded up some music and played it through this speaker and was pleased with the outcome. The speaker has no problem with playing at higher volume, without distortion or \\\\\\\\\"washing out\\\\\\\\\". The profile is very good too - the bass is strong and slightly elevated but not overkill, the midrange is very good and the music has depth as a result, and the highs are bright and crisp. For such a small speaker, this one produces better-than-expected sound.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite Bluetooth speakers. It is very small but it has excellent sound and is made very well. The size makes it placeable in areas where other speakers are too bulky to fit. This speaker proves that smaller speakers can have great sound and it\\'s worth its asking price.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review. Even though I received this product at no cost I have rated and reviewed this product without bias, based solely on my experience with it.er volume, without distortion or \\\\\\\\\"washing out\\\\\\\\\".

Cool LCD screen that shows the status of all the batteries.<br />2. 4 cell charging is done with a time-share system where only 2 batteries are actually being charged at the same time.<br />3. It can charge LiFePO4!<br />4. Cooling is a bit of a problem (for in depth, read the whole review)<br />5. Overall this is a charger with a good warranty. If you got a flashlight or ecig that goes through batteries like a mad man, this is a good candidate.<br /><br />Full review:<br /><br />The looks:<br /><br />The Nitecore D4's outer appearance is quite amazing. The curves tapers off the edges leaving the charger with an elegant look and feel, not that you will be holding the D4 like a phone watching the bars slowly move up. Since when it is fully populated with 3400mah Panasonic 18650's this D4 becomes a brick, a charging brick?<br /><br />The usage:<br /><br />The D4 can charge pretty much any battery you can find, with the exception of the 9v. (I wish Nitecore made a 9v battery adapter...) For the lithium groups, you can either have it cut off at 4.20v for Lithium ions/IMR. Or if you have LiFePO4's you can have it cut off at 3.60v. The charger can't automatically detect a LiFePO4 from a Lion battery, but all you need to do is hold the mode button until it switches over to LiFePO4. FYI, Holding the MODE button also puts it into &quot;Low&quot; speed charging, but keep holding it and it will switch over it LiFe. For NiMH and NiCD batteries, the D4 uses delta Voltage and delta Time (-dV/dt on the LCD), the D4 measures the change in voltage over the change in time to detect when the battery is full.<br /><br />**********Charging 101**********<br /><br />Lithium batteries:<br /><br />When charging a lithium battery, you use a constant current (CC) to bring the cell to a voltage of 3.6v/4.2v/4.35v. When the max voltage is reached, the processor of the D4 will switch over to constant voltage (CV) and it will wait until the current drops below a certain amount. When that current is reached, the D4 cuts the power supply and it will show the &quot;Charging Finished&quot; icon. On this particular charger, it doesn't do a continued float charging where it keeps the batteries topped off. So that means if you leave the charger plugged in and powered, after 1 year the battery voltage will be lower than the charge voltage, but the charger will still say &quot;Charging Finished&quot;. The same goes for all &quot;common&quot; Lithium batteries in all shapes and sizes. Notice I wrote &quot;common&quot;, so no charging Lithium-Air or Lithium perchlorate batteries in the D4…<br /><br />Just FYI, Lithium batteries when over discharged will be damaged, because the cathode and anode of the battery will be destroyed and cannot be reverted back to its original state, thus losing capacity on a massive scale. Over charging Lithium batteries can be catastrophic, because the cell will heat up and go into thermal runaway. (When the battery self-destructs, like a diesel engine burning motor oil, runaway diesel). It’s quite fascinating how lithium batteries symbolize our own DNA. Every time they get charged, their “ends” are damaged a little bit losing capacity just like how our DNA loses its telomeres every time it replicate.<br /><br />For NiMH/NiCD batteries:<br /><br />The D4 uses a –Delta Voltage over Delta Time, or in English, the change in voltage over the change in time. So when the D4 receives a dead Eneloop AA for example, it will begin to supply power and take down notes of the time. It will also start a virtual graph with slopes, plotting down many voltage measurements along the time axis. So now you have a timer, memory, and a virtual graph. Seem quite complex just to charge a battery right? Without going too deep into the charging algorithm, let me finish off this off. When the processor detects a sudden drop of voltage at the terminals, the charger will terminate the charge and call it complete. Becauseof the close relationship of temperature and voltage in the chemistry of the battery, having a thermal sensor right under the battery is not necessary.<br /><br />**********END CHARGING 101**********<br /><br />The bads about the D4:<br /><br />The thermal design of this charger is horrific. Despite the time-share charging system, it still uses mosfets with close to none heat sinking. I had to make custom copper heat sinks and fill the whole charger with thermal pads. Although we are at a state in tech where even at 100C these PN junctions still operate happily for a while. But for long-term durability, the heat created is never good. I can safely say that the charger will last a good year or two, but with that amount of heat produced, you can question the efficiency of this charger. Granted, it only uses 12v 1amp, 12 watts, but it is only charging at 1400ma (750ma x2) @ 4.2v.<br /><br />Bottom-line is this charger is a must have, if you have Skyray kings or Supfire m6’s. Even their own TM06 uses 4x 18650s. I have had this charger for almost a month already. Gave me no problems, I have charged all my Eneloops and my whole collection of unprotected 18650’s, 32 of them!<br /><br />I this was a review that I wish everyone could write.

Well, my pigtail was manufactured without those relief cuts. No amount of pressure will allow the male connector to be inserted in my NooElec RTL-SDR dongle, because there is no flex whatsoever. Needless to say, I am disappointed. Every photo of a MCX male plug that I've found online shows those relief cuts, so I assume they're part of the spec and this was just a massive screw-up by quality control. Maybe other people's MCX female ports have more flex to make up for it, but the plastic case of my RTL-SDR dongle won't even allow the rim of the male connector to pass.

       " \"Generally, I'm a huge fan of Antennas Direct. My family has bought several of their products, including: a C4, a C2, a db8e, and this VHF retrofit kit.<br /><br />To pull in a VHF station that is 43 miles away, we bought this kit that is listed having a range of 25-50+ miles. Aiming directly at the towers, I got 0% signal, even without combining the antennas, mounting this directly on my mast.<br /><br />Customer support at Antennas Direct says the range is good for 35 miles MAX. If they had written that on the product description instead of the confusing &#34;25-50+ miles&#34;, I probably wouldn't have spent my whole afternoon on the roof.<br /><br />This is a great solution if you're looking to add short range VHF to your signal downlead. Watch out for medium or long range, it might not work. It's just a pair of dipoles. If you have line of sight, you might be ok on longer range\",\n",

       " \"I bought this product after reading many reviews that didn't have much detail or specifics, such as TV size, type, equipment model numbers, viewing distance, default TV settings or optimized, room lighting, 2D/3D, which are all factors that impact viewing clarity. I purchased the product to experiment and provide that detail in one review. Overall this product DID bring out additional detail when viewed up close, it was just not noticeable from the location where we watch the TV in 2D or 3D. This is why I have given it an &#34;OK&#34; rating. We sit approximately 11 feet away from the TV in a completely dark room directly in front of the TV (No angle). I didn't really notice any difference until I was 2 feet away from the front of the TV.  The unit has a test mode where one half of the picture has been clarified and the other half has not, for your comparison. We primarily watch movies in Blu-ray or up-converted DVD's and all my equipment is Samsung. (TV has been setup to provide optimum color and clarity. (Not setup with factory default settings). TV Model Number: PN64D550C1F. Blu-ray player Model number is HT-D550). I also tried it on our cable input to see if that made much of a difference. It did not. Again, from our viewing position, we sit too far away for it to provide any noticeable improvement in clarity.<br />To sum up, it works as defined but really did not provide us with a better viewing experience for the size and type of TV based on the viewing distance we watch from. This unit is somewhat expensive and I would not recommend its purchase for TV's of my size and type or smaller.  I think it is really designed for very large screen projector style TV's.\",\n",

The volume control & answer call button are guaranteed to work with ALL Samsung designed Android devices, but I have a Droid Turbo.  From reading other reviews, it's a crop-shoot as to the level of functionality it may have with your android device.  I've had my Momentums for 2 years now, & this cable makes them sound great again, better than new in fact as it is true high-end headphones sound better with age!!  Also, notice the end of the cable you plug in, the &#34;low-profile angled plug&#34;; it has been redesigned as to decrease it's chance of breaking off or getting in the way of things.  Wanted to give 5 stars, but cannot for the reason aforementioned.  I hope Sennheiser releases a more universally compatible remote cable such as this in future, though the blame may be more on the device manufacturer side... Motorola!\",\n",

       " 'I have many other bluetooth headsets and this one has the expected range of about 15-25 feet maximum with clear line of sight to your phone or computer. However the audio will cut out here and there very so often.For under $15 the pair is ok for music. I do not recommend it for more than that price and I do not recommend it for video playback as the cheaper chipset inside loses slight connection even in clear line of sight to the bluetooth source and your video goes out of audio sync and that ruins it as a video playback bluetooth headset. Its mostly made of cheaply put together plastic so durability is not the greatest but its good enough if you take care and caution when putting then back in your backpack or purse etc. The fit is good and they say put for the most part, even though the wing tips that come with them are pretty much useless as they do not give a tight secure fit like many of the other more expensive bluetooth headsets do. I do not think they will be very sweat resistant so if you are a heavy sweater you may want to look elsewhere. However I cannot say for sure bc I do not not sweat a lot and even though its a cheap plastic build they do have the slightest of separation from your ear in that its hard to get actual drops of sweat on them unless you have longer hair and its wet or again are a real heavy sweater or runner etc.<br /><br />There are many generic branded versions of this headset (Mpow, iclever etc) and some are a little better with a better chipset and have aptx certification (supposedly, and its supposedly supposed to be better more CD like quality sound) so the filesonic version of this headset is the cheaper version but it sounds good enough for everyday or gym use. Im no audiophile and sound is subjective, but its good enough for me and on par with many other sets I have. I can only tell a slight decrease in quality vs the aptx certified version I also have but its so slight that Im sure only audiophiles can tell the difference.<br /><br />Overall I would recommended them for about $15 bucks or cheaper and pretty much for music only use and possibly the gym if you are not a runner or heavy sweater.br />Overall I would recommended them for about $15 bucks or cheaper and pretty much for music only use and possibly the gym if you are not a runner or heavy sweater.',\n",
